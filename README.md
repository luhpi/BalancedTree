# BalancedTree
  A balanced tree aplication which receive several inputs to create the data tree. After that, the aplication receive an instruction to break two (2) branches, in order to separate the tree in three smaller trees.
  Then, the aplication checks if, adding only one more leaf, all three trees will have the same value. If not, it returns -1.

  The last version updated still has some loop situations, which I am still working on. The code's logic is completed, with only those issues left to work on.
